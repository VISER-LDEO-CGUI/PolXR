# antARctica: AR visualizer for ice-penetrating radar data on Antarctica's Ross Ice Shelf

This application is being developed to facilitate the analysis of radar data for polar geophysicists by placing the data in context with the ice shelves over which it was collected. A thesis will be made public by October 2022 that gives a more robust explination of the underlying earth science and development process of this project. See the previous iteration of this project + a demo video at https://github.com/sofiasanchez985/greenland

Here is a list of interactions available using the Oculus Controllers:
| Interaction | Description |
| :-----------: | ----------- |
| Trigger Buttons | Used to interact with the menus and select radar images |
| Joysticks | Used to move around the entire scene freely |


Here is a list of interactions available with the main menu. All of these interactions can be used with the Oculus Controller trigger buttons:
| Main Menu Interaction Title | Description |
| :-----------: | ----------- |
| Surface DEM | Checking this button turns the Surface DEM on/off |
| Base DEM | Checking this button turns the Base DEM on/off |
| All Radar Images | Checking this button turns all the radar lines on/off |
| All CSV Picks | Checking this button turns all the CSV Picks on/off |
| Bounding Box | Checking this button turns the bounding box for the entire scene on/off |
| Vertical Exaggeration | Vertically stretches or shrinks the DEMs (the exaggeration is dynamic and can be repeated limitlessly) |
| Sidebar "X" | Closes the menu |
| Sidebar "Minimap" | Turns teleport mode on (dot will be green) or off (dot will be red and allows for moving the minimap itself) |
| Sidebar "Refresh" | Resets the entire scene |
| Sidebar "Pin" | Saves scene information to .txt file |
| Minimap | If teleport mode is enabled, teleports the user to that location in the scene |


Here is a list of interactions available with the line menu. All of these interactions can be used with the Oculus Controller trigger buttons:
| Line Menu Interaction Title | Description |
| :-----------: | ----------- |
| Vertical Exaggeration | Vertically stretches or shrinks the radar image (the exaggeration is dynamic and can be repeated limitlessly) |
| Horizontal Exaggeration | Horizontally stretches or shrinks the radar image (the exaggeration is dynamic and can be repeated limitlessly) |
| Rotation | Rotates the image by the seleced amount of degrees |
| Transparency | Makes the radar image transparent by the selected percent |
| View Radar Image | Checking this button turns the selected radar image on/off |
| View CSV Picks | Checking this button turns the selected CSV Picks on/off |
| Measurement Mode | Turns measurent mode on/off (allows user to place two marks on the same image and measure the distance between |
| Sidebar "X" | Closes the menu |
| Sidebar "Home" | Opens the main menu |
| Sidebar "Refresh" | Resets the radar line |
| Sidebar "Pin" | Saves the radar information to .txt file |
| Sidebar ">" | Teleports to the location of the radar line in the scene |


Here is a list of interactions available using voice commands. Simply say the word clearly and antARctica will process the command:
| Voice Command | Description |
| :-----------: | ----------- |
| "Menu" | Open/close the menu |
| "Model" | Turn on/off the DEM models |
| "Image" | Turn on/off the image for the selected radar line |
| "Line" | Turn on/off the CSV picks for the selected radar line |
| "Go" | Teleport to the image location for the selected radar line |
| "Mark" | Add a point to the image for the selected radar line |
| "Reset" | Reset the radar lines for the whole scene |
| "Measure" | Turn on/off measurement mode |
| "Box" | Turn on/off the bounding box for the entire scene |

--- This project is still in development!! ---

Working under our advisors Professor Steven Feiner, Alexandra Boghosian, Isabel Cordero, and Carmine Elvezio.
